						Delmar Larsen is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Biophysics Graduate
						Group in the University of California, Davis. Delmar received his Ph.D. from the University of
						Chicago (Chemistry) and did postdoctoral stints at the Free University Amsterdam (Biophysics)
						and the University of Southern California (Chemistry). In 2005, Delmar moved to the UC Davis as
						an Assistant Professor, was promoted to Associate Professor in 2012, and was promoted to Full Professor in 2019. Delmar‚Äôs current
						research interests extends across many scientific disciplines including biophysics, physical
						chemistry, molecular biology, and computational modeling, with a common thread of investigating
						and characterizing of rapid condensed phase dynamics. Delmar is the Founder and Director of the
						LibreTexts project consisting of twelve independently operating and
						interconnected libraries that focus on augmenting post-secondary education in specific fields in
						both STEM fields, social sciences, and humanities. Supported by a U.S. National Science
						Foundation ($1 million grants), the LibreTexts project is being built by over 1000 active
						developers (students, instructors and outside experts) across multiple campuses and nations. The
						chemistry library is the most trafficked chemistry education site in the world and the entire
						project is responsible for over 50 million student visitors annually. LibreTexts has served
						students with over 220 million pages since 2008, which resulted in half a millennium of
						confirmed reading. Approximately $US 30 million have been saved the past two years in the
						postsecondary textbook costs of over 40 campuses; much more is expected to be save in the future
						as the project grows is still growing exponentially in traffic and use.

She has presented on eBooks and continues to be interested in the ways in which electronic texts are utilized by students. She has a background in the Humanities and holds a Masters in Library and Information Science from San Jose State University, as well as a Masters in English from San Diego State University. Her prior research interests include the intersections of death and identity in literature and television. Most recently she has been working with the OER/ZTC task force at Grossmont Community College to help raise awareness about OER and open education on campus. Over the past several years she has become a fierce advocate for open education, and she is thrilled to be joining the LibreTexts team in the capacity of Outreach Coordinator.

					                       State, Rio Hondo Community College and Golden Gate University). I have
					                       witnessed the equity issue created by students who can easily afford their
					                       course content and those who cannot. It has always puzzled me that most
					                       services that help create student success on college campuses are covered by
					                       tuition and fees with the exception of course materials. The cost of a course
					                       (tuition) is the same for any major, with the exception of the course
					                       material cost. Some majors are much more expensive than others when it comes
					                       to content costs. Once again, this is an equity issue for our students. As a
					                       Textbook Manager for many years, I have had many students crying or otherwise
					                       upset in my office explaining how difficult it can be to get through a course
					                       without being able to afford access to the content being used. These
					                       experiences have created my passion for supporting no and low cost content
					                       options for our students.
